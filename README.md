My first Phaser game from the [Null to Full](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2015/06/08/get-my-first-indie-minibook-from-null-to-full-html5-cross-platform-game/) book by Emanuele Feronato.

The entire game design and almost all of the code were created by Emanuele Feronato. I just put it in the [Enclave Phaser Template](https://github.com/EnclaveGames/Enclave-Phaser-Template) as part of my learning experience.
